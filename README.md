Repeating group
In the repeating group I need to know what type of content my repeater will bring from the database and where it will bring it from with the data source. Most of the time, it goes to DO A SEARCH FOR and then chooses the type of content. In short, it will fetch the data from your database and place it on the screen. Remember that you also have to tell bubble to place this data on the screen. There, you can also set the number of rows and columns.
