Repeating group list of date
In the repeating group I need to know what type of content my repeater will bring from the database and where it will bring it from with the data source. Most of the time, it goes to DO A SEARCH FOR and then chooses the type of content. In short, it will fetch the data from your database and place it on the screen. Remember that you also have to tell bubble to place this data on the screen. There, you can also set the number of rows and columns.

Repeating group - appearance and layout
In most cases, within the repeating group, you place another simple group within the repeating group to make it look better, and in the group's appearance, you can change several things and can change almost everything and customize it completely.

floating group
normally used here for the header to make it fixed and it looks very nice and interesting to use in this case, used more in footers, headers and menus.
